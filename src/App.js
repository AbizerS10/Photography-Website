Luckily, when you hire a wedding photojournalist, you have someone on hand who is an expert in capturing those moments as memorable visual stories that you’ll enjoy for years to come."

Most WPJA members will probably tell you that you're not fully documenting the event unless you get out there on the periphery and record the subplots of the wedding day—the unique and intersecting stories of the guests as they enjoy the festivities."

Unlike the old days, photographers are coming up with the innovative ways to make a wedding album perfect. If you choose to do a pre-wedding photo shoot two to three months prior to your wedding day, you should be well known about your photographer much in advance. Hence, you can relax completely in front of the camera and be yourself throughout. It may help your photographer to discover your best angles and positions to make your wedding day photos outstanding. Furthermore, pre-wedding shoots can be considered as a trial photography session to make you prepare for your big day. Also, it will make you feel comfort with your photographer and also you will come to know his or her shooting style."

Historically, married women were at some stage of pregnancy for much of their life until the menopause, but the depiction of this in art is relatively uncommon, and generally restricted to some specific contexts."
